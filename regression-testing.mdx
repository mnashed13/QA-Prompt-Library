## Best Practices

When using these prompts:

1. **Be Comprehensive**
   - Cover all affected areas
   - Include related functionality
   - Consider integration points

2. **Prioritize Tests**
   - Focus on critical paths
   - Consider business impact
   - Include high-risk areas

3. **Maintain Efficiency**
   - Avoid redundant tests
   - Optimize test execution
   - Use test automation

4. **Document Changes**
   - Track modifications
   - Update test cases
   - Version control

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Start with Impact Analysis**
   - Identify affected areas
   - Assess risk levels
   - Determine test scope

2. **Use Test Automation**
   - Create automated scripts
   - Set up CI/CD integration
   - Monitor execution results

3. **Maintain Test Data**
   - Keep data current
   - Version control data
   - Document data requirements

4. **Review and Update**
   - Regular test reviews
   - Update test cases
   - Remove obsolete tests

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Incomplete Coverage**
   - ❌ "Test the changes"
   - ✅ "Test all user profile features, including registration, editing, and deletion"

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - ❌ "Run the tests"
   - ✅ "Run tests with required database setup, API endpoints, and user permissions"

3. **Poor Test Organization**
   - ❌ "Random test execution"
   - ✅ "Execute tests in order: core functionality, integration points, edge cases"

4. **Inadequate Documentation**
   - ❌ "Update tests"
   - ✅ "Update test cases with new requirements, test data, and expected results"
