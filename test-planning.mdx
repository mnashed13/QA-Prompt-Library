Focus Areas:
1. Load Testing
2. Stress Testing
3. Endurance Testing
4. Spike Testing
5. Volume Testing

Include:
- Performance Metrics
- Test Scenarios
- Test Data Requirements
- Monitoring Strategy
- Success Criteria
- Resource Requirements
```

### Security Test Planning

```text
Generate a security test plan for:
[System/Feature]: [Description]

Coverage Areas:
1. Authentication
2. Authorization
3. Data Protection
4. Network Security
5. Compliance Requirements

Include:
- Security Test Scenarios
- Vulnerability Assessment
- Penetration Testing
- Compliance Checks
- Risk Mitigation
```

## Best Practices

When using these prompts:

1. **Be Comprehensive**
   - Cover all test types
   - Include all stakeholders
   - Consider all risks

2. **Be Specific**
   - Define clear objectives
   - Set measurable criteria
   - Specify timelines

3. **Consider Resources**
   - Available personnel
   - Test environments
   - Tools and equipment

4. **Plan for Risks**
   - Identify potential issues
   - Define mitigation strategies
   - Include contingency plans

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Start with Clear Objectives**
   - Define test goals
   - Set success criteria
   - Identify key stakeholders

2. **Include All Test Types**
   - Functional testing
   - Non-functional testing
   - Regression testing
   - Integration testing

3. **Consider Dependencies**
   - System dependencies
   - Resource dependencies
   - Timeline dependencies

4. **Plan for Documentation**
   - Test cases
   - Test results
   - Defect reports
   - Status reports

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Incomplete Scope**
   - ❌ "Test the system"
   - ✅ "Test user authentication, payment processing, and order management"

2. **Missing Resources**
   - ❌ "Need testers"
   - ✅ "Need 2 QA engineers, 1 automation engineer, and test environment with specific configurations"

3. **Unclear Criteria**
   - ❌ "Test until stable"
   - ✅ "All critical bugs resolved, 95% test coverage achieved, performance metrics met"

4. **Inadequate Risk Planning**
   - ❌ "Handle issues as they come"
   - ✅ "Identified risks: server downtime, data corruption, network latency. Mitigation: backup systems, data validation, monitoring"
