# Prompt Structure

This guide explains how to structure effective prompts for QA testing scenarios. A well-structured prompt helps AI models generate more accurate and useful responses.

## Basic Prompt Components

### 1. Context
Provide clear context about:
- The feature or functionality being tested
- The testing environment
- Any relevant dependencies
- Current state or conditions

### 2. Requirements
List specific requirements including:
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Business rules
- Technical constraints

### 3. Expected Output Format
Specify the format you want the response in:
- Test case structure
- Bug report format
- Test plan sections
- Performance metrics

### 4. Additional Parameters
Include any specific parameters like:
- Priority levels
- Test types
- Test categories
- Performance thresholds

## Example Structure

```text
[Context]
Feature/Functionality: [Name]
Environment: [Details]
Dependencies: [List]

[Requirements]
1. [Requirement 1]
2. [Requirement 2]
...

[Expected Output]
Please provide:
- [Output format 1]
- [Output format 2]
...

[Additional Parameters]
Priority: [Level]
Test Type: [Type]
Categories: [List]
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**
   - Use clear, unambiguous language
   - Include exact values where applicable
   - Specify version numbers and dependencies

2. **Provide Context**
   - Explain the purpose of the test
   - Include relevant background information
   - Mention any constraints or limitations

3. **Structure Clearly**
   - Use consistent formatting
   - Break down complex requirements
   - Use bullet points for clarity

4. **Include Examples**
   - Show sample inputs and outputs
   - Provide real-world scenarios
   - Include edge cases

5. **Specify Constraints**
   - Time limitations
   - Resource constraints
   - Technical limitations

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Vague Language**
   - ❌ "Test the login feature"
   - ✅ "Test the login feature with email validation, password requirements, and session management"

2. **Missing Context**
   - ❌ "Generate test cases"
   - ✅ "Generate test cases for the payment processing system in a production environment"

3. **Incomplete Requirements**
   - ❌ "Test the API"
   - ✅ "Test the REST API endpoints for user management with authentication and rate limiting"

4. **Unclear Output Format**
   - ❌ "Write a bug report"
   - ✅ "Write a bug report following the standard template with severity, priority, and reproduction steps"

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Start with a Template**
   - Use predefined templates for consistency
   - Customize based on specific needs
   - Maintain version control of templates

2. **Review and Refine**
   - Test prompts with different AI models
   - Gather feedback from team members
   - Update based on results

3. **Document Success**
   - Keep track of effective prompts
   - Share successful examples
   - Build a prompt library

4. **Iterate and Improve**
   - Start with basic prompts
   - Add complexity gradually
   - Refine based on results
