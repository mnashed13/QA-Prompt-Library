# Automation Testing Prompts

This section provides prompts designed to help you create effective automated test scripts and frameworks using AI. These prompts ensure maintainable and reliable test automation.

## Basic Automation Test Generation

# Important Notes

Some important notes that can help with is to iterate your prompts, meaning that you take a bigger task and break it down into smaller ones. So instead of ask chatGPT to build a whole automation stack with one prompt,
better to focus on one part of the automation and edit manually when needed. This process I find yields the best results.

## Basic Automation Test Generation

### Prompt Template

```json
Generate automated test scripts for:
[Feature/System]: [Brief description]

Technology Stack:
- Framework: [Name]
- Language: [Name]
- Tools: [List]

Test Requirements:
1. [Requirement 1]
2. [Requirement 2]
...

Please include:
- Test Structure
- Page Objects
- Test Data
- Assertions
- Error Handling
```

### Example Usage

```text
Generate automated test scripts for:
User Authentication: Login and registration flows

Technology Stack:
- Framework: Selenium WebDriver
- Language: Python
- Tools: pytest, Page Object Model

Test Requirements:
1. Login with valid credentials
2. Login with invalid credentials
3. Password reset flow
4. Registration process
5. Session management

Please include:
- Test Structure
- Page Objects
- Test Data
- Assertions
- Error Handling
```

## Advanced Automation Testing

### Framework Setup

```text
Generate automation framework setup for:
[Project Name]: [Description]

Components:
1. Test Runner
2. Page Objects
3. Utilities
4. Reporting
5. CI/CD Integration

Include:
- Project Structure
- Dependencies
- Configuration
- Helper Functions
- Reporting Setup
```

### API Automation

```text
Generate API automation scripts for:
[API Service]: [Description]

Coverage Areas:
1. Endpoint Testing
2. Request/Response Validation
3. Authentication
4. Error Handling
5. Performance Checks

Include:
- Test Cases
- Request Templates
- Response Validation
- Error Scenarios
- Integration Tests
```

## Best Practices

When using these prompts:

1. **Follow Design Patterns**

   - Page Object Model
   - Factory Pattern
   - Builder Pattern
   - Strategy Pattern

2. **Maintain Code Quality**

   - Clean code principles
   - Code organization
   - Documentation
   - Version control

3. **Handle Test Data**

   - Data management
   - Test data generation
   - Data cleanup
   - Data isolation

4. **Implement Reporting**
   - Test results
   - Screenshots
   - Logs
   - Metrics

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Start with Framework**

   - Choose appropriate tools
   - Set up project structure
   - Configure dependencies
   - Implement base classes

2. **Organize Tests**

   - Logical grouping
   - Clear naming
   - Proper structure
   - Easy maintenance

3. **Handle Dependencies**

   - External services
   - Database
   - File system
   - Network

4. **Implement CI/CD**
   - Automated builds
   - Test execution
   - Reporting
   - Notifications

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Poor Framework Design**

   - ❌ "Write test scripts"
   - ✅ "Implement Page Object Model with reusable components and proper abstraction"

2. **Missing Error Handling**

   - ❌ "Basic test cases"
   - ✅ "Comprehensive test cases with proper error handling and recovery mechanisms"

3. **Inadequate Reporting**

   - ❌ "Run tests"
   - ✅ "Run tests with detailed reporting, screenshots, and performance metrics"

4. **Poor Maintenance**
   - ❌ "Fix when broken"
   - ✅ "Regular code reviews, updates, and refactoring to maintain code quality"
