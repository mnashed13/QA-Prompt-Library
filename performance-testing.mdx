# Performance Testing Prompts

This section provides prompts designed to help you create effective performance test scenarios using AI. These prompts ensure thorough testing of system performance under various conditions.

## Basic Performance Test Generation

### Prompt Template

```text
Generate performance test scenarios for:
[System/Feature]: [Brief description]

Performance Requirements:
- Response Time: [Target]
- Concurrent Users: [Number]
- Throughput: [Target]
- Resource Usage: [Limits]

Test Types:
1. [Test Type 1]
2. [Test Type 2]
...

Please include:
- Test Scenarios
- Test Data Requirements
- Monitoring Points
- Success Criteria
- Resource Requirements
```

### Example Usage

```text
Generate performance test scenarios for:
E-commerce Checkout Process: Payment processing under load

Performance Requirements:
- Response Time: < 2 seconds
- Concurrent Users: 1000
- Throughput: 100 transactions/minute
- Resource Usage: CPU < 80%, Memory < 70%

Test Types:
1. Load Testing
2. Stress Testing
3. Endurance Testing
4. Spike Testing

Please include:
- Test Scenarios
- Test Data Requirements
- Monitoring Points
- Success Criteria
- Resource Requirements
```

## Advanced Performance Testing

### Load Testing Scenarios

```text
Generate load test scenarios for:
[System/Feature]: [Description]

Focus Areas:
1. User Load
2. Data Volume
3. Transaction Rate
4. Resource Utilization
5. Response Times

Include:
- Test Scripts
- Test Data
- Monitoring Strategy
- Success Metrics
- Failure Criteria
```

### Stress Testing Scenarios

```text
Generate stress test scenarios for:
[System/Feature]: [Description]

Stress Points:
1. System Limits
2. Resource Exhaustion
3. Error Handling
4. Recovery Time
5. Data Integrity

Include:
- Test Scenarios
- Monitoring Points
- Failure Criteria
- Recovery Procedures
- Analysis Methods
```

## Best Practices

When using these prompts:

1. **Define Clear Metrics**
   - Response times
   - Throughput
   - Resource usage
   - Error rates

2. **Plan Test Data**
   - Data volume
   - Data variety
   - Data distribution
   - Data cleanup

3. **Monitor Resources**
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Network usage
   - Disk I/O

4. **Document Results**
   - Test conditions
   - Test results
   - Analysis
   - Recommendations

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Start with Baseline**
   - Measure current performance
   - Document normal behavior
   - Set performance targets

2. **Use Appropriate Tools**
   - Load testing tools
   - Monitoring tools
   - Analysis tools
   - Reporting tools

3. **Plan Test Environment**
   - Hardware requirements
   - Network setup
   - Test data
   - Monitoring setup

4. **Analyze Results**
   - Performance metrics
   - Bottlenecks
   - Optimization opportunities
   - Recommendations

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Incomplete Metrics**
   - ❌ "Test system performance"
   - ✅ "Test system performance with response time < 2s, throughput > 100 TPS"

2. **Poor Test Data**
   - ❌ "Use test data"
   - ✅ "Use production-like data with 100,000 user profiles and 1M transactions"

3. **Missing Monitoring**
   - ❌ "Run performance tests"
   - ✅ "Run performance tests with CPU, memory, network, and database monitoring"

4. **Unclear Criteria**
   - ❌ "Test until it breaks"
   - ✅ "Test until response time exceeds 5s or error rate exceeds 1%"
