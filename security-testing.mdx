# Security Testing Prompts

This section provides prompts designed to help you create effective security test scenarios using AI. These prompts ensure thorough testing of system security and vulnerability assessment.

## Basic Security Test Generation

### Prompt Template

```text
Generate security test scenarios for:
[System/Feature]: [Brief description]

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: [Requirements]
- Authorization: [Requirements]
- Data Protection: [Requirements]
- Compliance: [Standards]

Test Types:
1. [Test Type 1]
2. [Test Type 2]
...

Please include:
- Test Scenarios
- Test Data
- Security Tools
- Success Criteria
- Risk Assessment
```

### Example Usage

```text
Generate security test scenarios for:
User Authentication System: Login and session management

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Multi-factor authentication required
- Authorization: Role-based access control
- Data Protection: Encryption at rest and in transit
- Compliance: OWASP Top 10, GDPR

Test Types:
1. Authentication Testing
2. Authorization Testing
3. Session Management
4. Input Validation
5. Security Headers

Please include:
- Test Scenarios
- Test Data
- Security Tools
- Success Criteria
- Risk Assessment
```

## Advanced Security Testing

### Penetration Testing

```text
Generate penetration test scenarios for:
[System/Feature]: [Description]

Focus Areas:
1. Network Security
2. Application Security
3. Data Security
4. Access Control
5. Compliance

Include:
- Test Scenarios
- Tools Required
- Success Criteria
- Risk Levels
- Remediation Steps
```

### Vulnerability Assessment

```text
Generate vulnerability assessment scenarios for:
[System/Feature]: [Description]

Assessment Areas:
1. OWASP Top 10
2. Common Vulnerabilities
3. Security Misconfigurations
4. Data Exposure
5. Access Control Issues

Include:
- Test Cases
- Scanning Tools
- Analysis Methods
- Risk Assessment
- Mitigation Steps
```

## Best Practices

When using these prompts:

1. **Follow Security Standards**
   - OWASP guidelines
   - Industry standards
   - Compliance requirements
   - Security best practices

2. **Use Appropriate Tools**
   - Security scanners
   - Penetration testing tools
   - Code analysis tools
   - Monitoring tools

3. **Document Findings**
   - Vulnerabilities
   - Risk levels
   - Impact assessment
   - Remediation steps

4. **Maintain Security**
   - Regular updates
   - Security patches
   - Access reviews
   - Compliance checks

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Start with Assessment**
   - Security baseline
   - Risk assessment
   - Compliance check
   - Tool selection

2. **Plan Test Approach**
   - Test scope
   - Test methods
   - Resource allocation
   - Timeline

3. **Execute Tests**
   - Follow methodology
   - Document findings
   - Assess impact
   - Prioritize issues

4. **Report Results**
   - Findings
   - Risk levels
   - Recommendations
   - Action items

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Incomplete Coverage**
   - ❌ "Test security"
   - ✅ "Test OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, authentication, authorization, and data protection"

2. **Missing Tools**
   - ❌ "Manual testing"
   - ✅ "Use security scanners, penetration testing tools, and code analysis tools"

3. **Poor Documentation**
   - ❌ "Found vulnerabilities"
   - ✅ "Documented vulnerabilities with risk levels, impact, and remediation steps"

4. **Inadequate Follow-up**
   - ❌ "Fixed issues"
   - ✅ "Verified fixes, updated security controls, and documented changes"
