### Overview

While large-language models demonstrate remarkable zero-shot capabilities, they still fall short on more complex tasks when using the zero-shot setting. Few-shot prompting can be used as a technique to enable in-context learning where we provide demonstrations in the prompt to steer the model to better performance. The demonstrations serve as conditioning for subsequent examples where we would like the model to generate a response.

### Prompt Examples

**API Endpoint Validation**:

```json
- Prompt: "Validate the response format of the `/users` endpoint for a GET request."
- Example Test Case: "Verify that the response contains a JSON object with keys 'id', 'name', and 'email'."
```

**API Authentication**:

```json
- Prompt: "Test the authentication mechanism for the `/login` endpoint."
- Example Test Case: "Verify that a valid username and password combination returns a valid authentication token."
```

**API Data Integrity**:

```json
- Prompt: "Ensure data consistency across multiple API endpoints."
- Example Test Case: "Verify that the user data retrieved from the `/users` endpoint matches the data stored in the database."
```

**UI Element Validation**:

```json
- Prompt: "Validate the presence and functionality of UI elements on the login page."
- Example Test Case: "Verify that the login form contains input fields for username and password, and a submit button that triggers the login functionality."
```

**UI Navigation**:

```json
- Prompt: "Test the navigation flow between different pages of the application."
- Example Test Case: "Verify that clicking on the 'Dashboard' link navigates the user to the dashboard page."
```

**UI Responsiveness**:

```json
- Prompt: "Ensure the application UI is responsive across different devices and screen sizes."
- Example Test Case: "Verify that the layout and functionality of the application remain consistent when viewed on a desktop, tablet, and mobile device."
```
