# Test Case Generation Prompts

This section provides prompts designed to help you generate comprehensive test cases using AI. These prompts are structured to ensure thorough coverage of functionality while maintaining clarity and specificity.

## Basic Test Case Generation

### Prompt Template

```text
Generate test cases for the following feature/functionality:
[Feature Name]: [Brief description of the feature]

Requirements:
1. [Requirement 1]
2. [Requirement 2]
...

Please include:
- Test case ID
- Test case description
- Pre-conditions
- Test steps
- Expected results
- Priority level (High/Medium/Low)
- Test type (Functional/Non-functional)
```

### Example Usage

```text
Generate test cases for the following feature/functionality:
User Authentication: Login functionality for a web application

Requirements:
1. Users must be able to login with email and password
2. Password must be at least 8 characters long
3. System should show appropriate error messages for invalid credentials
4. Users should be able to reset their password
5. System should prevent brute force attacks

Please include:
- Test case ID
- Test case description
- Pre-conditions
- Test steps
- Expected results
- Priority level (High/Medium/Low)
- Test type (Functional/Non-functional)
```

## Advanced Test Case Generation

### Edge Cases and Boundary Testing

```text
Generate edge case and boundary test cases for:
[Feature Name]: [Brief description]

Consider:
1. Input validation boundaries
2. System limitations
3. Performance thresholds
4. Data volume limits
5. Time-based scenarios

For each test case, include:
- Scenario description
- Input values
- Expected behavior
- Potential risks
- Mitigation strategies
```

### Integration Test Cases

```text
Generate integration test cases for:
[Feature Name] integration with [Dependent System]

Focus on:
1. Data flow between systems
2. API interactions
3. Error handling
4. Performance impact
5. Security considerations

Include:
- Integration points
- Data mapping
- Error scenarios
- Recovery procedures
- Performance metrics
```

## Best Practices

When using these prompts:

1. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed requirements and context
2. **Include Constraints**: Mention any technical limitations or business rules
3. **Consider Dependencies**: List any system dependencies or prerequisites
4. **Define Success Criteria**: Clearly state what constitutes a successful test
5. **Review and Refine**: Always review AI-generated test cases and adjust as needed

## Tips for Better Results

- Start with clear, well-defined requirements
- Break down complex features into smaller, testable components
- Include both positive and negative test scenarios
- Consider security and performance implications
- Review generated test cases for completeness and accuracy

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Vague or ambiguous requirements
- Missing pre-conditions or dependencies
- Incomplete test steps
- Unclear success criteria
- Overlooking edge cases

## Example Output Structure

```markdown
Test Case ID: TC-001
Description: Verify successful login with valid credentials
Pre-conditions:
- User account exists in the system
- User is not already logged in
- System is accessible

Test Steps:
1. Navigate to login page
2. Enter valid email address
3. Enter valid password
4. Click login button

Expected Results:
- User is successfully logged in
- Dashboard page is displayed
- User session is created

Priority: High
Test Type: Functional
