2. **Test Coverage Matrix**

- Create a matrix mapping prompt techniques to features
- Ensure comprehensive coverage across different model capabilities
- Track testing gaps and priorities

3. **Version Control for Prompts**

- Maintain a repository of test prompts
- Version prompts alongside model versions
- Document prompt modifications and their impact

## Measuring Effectiveness

Track these metrics for your prompt-based tests:

- Success rate of test cases
- Consistency of responses
- Response latency
- Edge case handling
- Error recovery
- Safety compliance

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Overly Complex Prompts**

   - Keep instructions clear and specific
   - Break down complex tests into smaller units

2. **Inconsistent Formatting**

   - Maintain consistent prompt structure
   - Use templates for similar test cases

3. **Inadequate Coverage**
   - Test both happy paths and edge cases
   - Include cross-lingual and cultural scenarios depending on the context of the project.
